## üñºÔ∏è Project Overview

This project focuses on solving an **image classification** problem using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, a widely used benchmark in computer vision containing 60,000 images across 10 classes.  

---

## üß† Approach

A custom **deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was designed and trained from scratch to classify images into their respective categories.  
- Achieves **over 80% accuracy** on the test set  
- Uses a **plain CNN architecture** without residual connections (ResNets, DenseNets, etc.)  
- Demonstrates that strong performance can be achieved with a carefully tuned standard CNN

## ‚ú® Key Features

- End-to-end training on **CIFAR-10**  
- Customizable CNN architecture for experimentation  
- Achieves competitive accuracy without advanced architectural components  
- Serves as a baseline for comparing with more complex models (ResNets, Vision Transformers, etc.)
